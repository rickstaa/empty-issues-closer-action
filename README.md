## Pre-requisites

Create a workflow `.yml` file in your `.github/workflows` directory. An [example workflow](#examples-workflow---close-empty-issues-and-unfiled-templates) is available below. For more information, reference the GitHub Help Documentation for [creating a workflow file](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-workflows#creating-a-workflow-file).

## Inputs

Various inputs are defined in [action.yml](action.yml) to let you configure the action:

> [!WARNING]\
> The action looks for [markdown templates](https://docs.github.com/en/communities/using-templates-to-encourage-useful-issues-and-pull-requests/manually-creating-a-single-issue-template-for-your-repository) in the `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE` folder. Please ensure that you added your templates to this folder for the `check_templates` action to work. This action only checks [markdown based issue templates](https://docs.github.com/en/communities/using-templates-to-encourage-useful-issues-and-pull-requests/manually-creating-a-single-issue-template-for-your-repository#adding-an-issue-template) since for YAML based GitHub form schema templates GitHub provides the `validations` property which can be used to prevent empty form templates from being submitted.

## Outputs

This action currently does not have any outputs.

## Examples workflow - Close empty issues and templates

The following example uses the [issue](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-workflows/events-that-trigger-workflows#schedule) event to run the empty-issues-closer-action every time an issue is `opened`, `reopened` or `edited` with all features enabled.

## FAQ

### How does this differ from the 'blank_issues_enabled' key in the template chooser config

As of [October 28, 2019](https://github.blog/changelog/2019-10-28-new-issue-template-configuration-options/), users can use a template configuration file to configure the issue templates. The `blank_issues_enabled` option allows you to show or hide the 'Open a blank issue' choice when users select the 'New issue' button in your repository.

![Open a black issue](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/17570430/194772445-0490b3a9-c431-4b47-93b3-3d1e4fc3b4db.png)

This option, however, doesn't prevent users from creating empty issues using the `/issues/new` path. This GitHub action automatically closes empty issues or issues with an unchanged template.

### How to prevent empty YAML-based templates from being submitted

For issue templates that are written in YAML (i.e. GitHub form schema templates), GitHub provides the `validations` property, which can be used to prevent empty templates from being submitted (see [the GitHub documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/communities/using-templates-to-encourage-useful-issues-and-pull-requests/configuring-issue-templates-for-your-repository#creating-issue-forms) for more information).
